# Module 10: Separation of Content from Design


##### What You'll Learn

You will analyze both the markup you’ve developed so far and the CSS you’re written to style that markup. You will reflect on how well you’ve implemented strategies to separate your content from your presentation, or the degree to which your content contains presentational information that could / should be removed.

##### What You'll Produce
You will produce a 1 page report that reflects on the current state of your portfolio development and outlines the work you’ll do to improve the separation or what you’ll continue to do to ensure that your final product is a complete separation of the two.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Analyze your markup and your CSS.** View the source of all of the HTML documents you’ve produced so far and assess how well you have (or haven’t) managed to separate content from presentation.

2. **Summarize your findings.** Using markdown syntax on Notehub (https://notehub.org), compose a 1-page report about your practices thus far. What were you deliberately doing up to this point to keep content and presentation separated? Where did you find shortcomings in your markup? What will you do differently going forward to ensure that your markup is clean and free of presentational information?

3. **Publish your Notehub and provide a link to your Notehub on your course repository website.** If you want any examples for markdown syntax formatting or characters, go to this resource (https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/). You can also check the #resources channel on Slack for a useful formatting template.
